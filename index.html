            My name is Dakota Jones. I am an inspiring full stack developer from Kansas City, Missouri. <br> I currently have spent the last four years as a classroom teacher and assistant Boy's Basketball Coach. Three of the years I spent teaching in St. Jospeh Missouri and this past year I have spent teaching with the North Kansas City School District. Currently I am enrolled in the KU full stack web development bootcamp and during the course we have built responsive, accessible and professional websites using the latest W3 web standards.<br>Through this bootcamp I have gained the knowledge and passion to continue a carrer in web development and hope this portfolio can showcase the skills I have learned to you. All websites below will be linked to show my potential to fit for a given postiion.
